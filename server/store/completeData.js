Devastated with this incident, he goes in search of the man responsible for this, without even knowing any details of him. While people advice him to take the help of God, PK too sets out in search of 'God'. Gradually, he realizes that God isn't a 'single person' as there are different Gods and to reach him there are his 'messengers' (read 'Godmen').

      description: " 3 IDIOTS belongs to everyone. But, yes, there's no denying that Aamir makes you forget all his past achievements as you watch the amazing actor play Rancho. To state that this ranks amongst his finest works would be an understatement. Madhavan is incredible, especially in the sequence when he explains his point of view to his father [Pareekshit Sahani]. Sharman is outstanding from start to end. This was a difficult role to portray and only an actor of calibre could've pulled it off. Boman is superb as the vicious head of the institute. The scenes between Aamir and Boman are extra-ordinary and it's a treat to watch these two powerful actors clash on the big screen, without getting overdramatic. Boman's appearance, mannerisms and dialogue delivery are exemplary.\n\nThe length of Kareena's role may not be as much as Aamir, Madhavan and Sharman, but she registers a strong impact nonetheless. Omi is excellent and the viewers are sure to love his acidic tongue and gestures in the movie. Mona Singh doesn't get much scope. Jaaved Jaffery is competent. Pareekshit Sahani is decent.\n\nOn the whole, 3 IDIOTS easily ranks amongst Aamir, Rajkumar Hirani and Vidhu Vinod Chopra's finest films. Do yourself and your family a favour: Watch 3 IDIOTS. It's emotional, it's entertaining, it's enlightening. The film has tremendous youth appeal and feel-good factor to work in a big way."

He starts narrating him his story as an engineering student in Mumbai’s National College of Technology. He’s allotted a room in Hostel no 4 aka H4, considered to be the residence of the ‘Losers’. At first, Anni is flabbergasted with the kind of characters in H4. But slowly, he becomes good friends with some of them like Gurmeet Singh Dhillon aka Sexa (Varun Sharma), Acid (Navin Polishetty), Sundar aka Mummy (Tushar Pandey), Bevda (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) and Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin).

I can't be certain though, because I'd have to re-watch them all to make sure I'm not making a bad recommendation, and I'm not super keen on doing that seeing as this one and the one preceding it were both kinda... bad.  The mythology of Insidious is something I am very interested in, and The Last Key added it to it somewhat. But if this is the sort of quality we can expect from future instalments, then maybe we should never see the resolution"

After getting her first pair of hearing aids, Christine found the noises profound.\n\n 'It was surprising to stop and hear what things actually sound like to other people,' she said. 'I sat down beside a construction site just to hear the different noises. I like to listen to the machines running. My favorite is the 18-wheelers driving around the site'. \n\n  'The rumble sounds better than before.'\n\n  Christine struggled to hear out of her left ear for her whole life. In March, she was prescribed her first pair of hearing aids. In addition to dramatically improving her hearing, they also notably improved her balance. \n\n Christine is one of the 38 million Americans who have some degree of hearing loss. Hers was genetic, but many more are put at risk by exposure to loud noises. The World Health Organization estimates that over a billion young adults are at risk of hearing loss 'due to unsafe listening practices.' "

A VPN creates an encrypted connection between your devices and the internet, which allows you to browse securely and keep your sensitive data away from prying eyes. We've tested out and rounded up some of the the best VPNs available in 2023, and now we've short-listed some of the best offers you can get right now to help you sign up with a VPN service at a low price. \n\n There are many good reasons to use a virtual private network. For example, did you know your internet service provider amasses as much data as possible on your digital activity? A 2021 Federal Trade Commission report noted that the leading ISPs have gathered user data on topics as personal as race, sexual orientation and real-time location. They've combined it, cross-referenced it and shared it with third-party partners. Yikes."

  description: "Continuous glucose monitors were developed for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The devices typically attach to the upper arm via skin-piercing filaments. They’re kept in place with an adhesive that makes them look like a nicotine patch. \n\n Continuous glucose monitors help people with diabetes identify swings in blood sugar before they cause problems. For those who depend on insulin, the CGM device can help their doctor modify the dose. \n\n It was only a matter of time until people without diabetes began exploring the potential of CGMs to help them meet their goals. \n\n An endurance athlete, for example, might want to know if continuous glucose monitors could help them maintain steady fuel levels.

Your new self (the one who runs!) begins Jan 1.\n\n Because your brain distinguishes between these two selves, it’s much easier to believe that your “new self” will succeed.\n\n That might sound silly: After all, you won’t actually magically transform the moment the ball drops on New Year’s Eve or a new calendar day dawns.\n\n  But human psychology is a funny thing, and this separation of self enables us to release ourselves from our past “failures,” and believe that a different way forward is possible.\n\n That belief is critical for behavior change.\n\n “When we believe we can get better at something, we develop self-efficacy,” says Dr. Nordin. “Self-efficacy leads to increased motivation, enabling us to tackle the challenges in front of us, which ultimately leads to behavior change.” "

Like a personal tour guide, you have expertise, insider’s knowledge, and ideas on the best things to do, but you don’t have a programmed route that you’ll force clients to stick to.  You might share some of your insights, but ultimately, your clients will decide where to go.   A good Motivational Interviewing coach will also be genuinely curious, respectful, and non-judgemental about a client’s preferences.(“Oh, you’d rather spend the day picnicking on the Seine instead of visiting the Eiffel Tower? I totally get that.”) \n\n You respect your client’s autonomy, and interact with them as an equal partner. \n\n You often say, “What would you like to do next? I have some ideas, but I’d love to hear what you’re thinking first.” \n\n  As a result, even when they’re in foreign territory, clients end up feeling supported, but also free. "

Silky, rich, full of deep flavor and a flash of heat! \n\n I would say this recipe belongs less in the “normal family dinner” category and more in the “hangry / hardcore craving / last minute meal” category.\n\nThe big flavors end up being a bit much for my kids, so I make this for a need-it-right-now hungry mom moment that calls for something ultra-satisfying, silky, and spicy. I often end up eating it right over the stove in a moment of pure and absolute joy. \n\nAnd luckily, the components can work for everybody (buttered noodles is always a kid win, plus eggs and broccoli!), so it can be easily worked into something family-friendly or meal-prep friendly if you batch some extra broccoli and eggs to throw into other meals throughout the week. SOS at its finest. \n\n The miso just does something magical to this whole thing – if you don’t have it I think you’ll still end up just fine. But if you have it (hopefully I already convinced you to buy some with the Miso Crunch Salad!) it will elevate the flavor and add a depth that’s just really amazing for such a fast and easy recipe."

It was a feeding frenzy. \n\n Of course, we love salmon. It’s a great source of nutrition and protein and, when cooked well, it gently slides apart into buttery, juicy, delightful little flakes.\n\n But I’m not going to lie to you: the main event here is that mango corn salsa. \n\n The salmon itself is completely SOS (taco seasoning and THAT’S IT), which is why I think it makes sense to put all your effort and energy into the salsa. This salsa is also the thing that’s going to keep you sitting at the table long after you’re done eating tacos, just scooping some extra salsa bites all on its own and suddenly thinking of it as more of a salad? It can be a salad, right? I would totally eat this salsa on its own as a salad.  Each bite is extra crispy and unexpected from the raw sweet corn and cucumber with a little burst of juicy flavor. But it’s also mainstream enough with the mango that my two young kids are usually happy to devour it right along with us. \n\n I love a million sauces on my tacos (okay, fine, on every recipe). But with this one, all it needs is a bit of extra lime and honey to finish it off. Simple, minimal effort, max deliciousness."
